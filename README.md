# Segmentation-of-L-forms
This repository deals with segmentation of l-forms.
Segmentation of L-forms done in 2 ways: Deep Neural Networks (in Python) and Model Based (Matlab).
Deep Neural Network uses U-net. Model-based approach uses morphological operations. 
For details see report.

P.S. Only sample test data is provided. These data was not seen during training process.
